The webЯcade feed editor, located at [editor.webrcade.com](https://editor.webrcade.com), provides a much simpler alternative to the [manual creation](https://docs.webrcade.com/feeds/tutorial/) of feeds. The editor allows for quickly creating webЯcade feeds without requiring any knowledge of the underlying [document format](https://docs.webrcade.com/feeds/format/).

The editor also includes a ROM *analyzer* that is capable of determining the appropriate [Application](https://docs.webrcade.com/apps/) type (emulator, etc.) for ROMs as well as any associated meta-information (title, properties, description, and related artwork). The *analyze* operation is similar to *scraping* functionality found in other front-ends with the primary difference being that in addition to meta-information the analyzer also establishes the application type and related properties.

The editor provides [several ways](https://docs.webrcade.com/editor/workspace/addingitems/) to create and add items (games, etc.) to feeds. The simplest way being to simply [drag and drop ROM-based links](https://docs.webrcade.com/editor/draganddrop/#drag-rom-urls) into the editor's [workspace](https://docs.webrcade.com/editor/workspace/).
