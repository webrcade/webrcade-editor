- Bug
  - After first loading editor, go to test, shows a combined of "default" feed and new feed... odd.
    - May be async bug/issue
    - Appears to have to do w/ the same element being in both (Freak vs. Default). When this happens, does not change image
      - Maybe need to revisit key, etc.
  - Still have sizing issues, etc. when using editor and using "test" mode on iOS and Android...
    - Should another iFrame be used for "test" on mobile?

- Import of feed files in front-end?
  - Good solution for exporting/importing locally...
    - Add Feed: Buttons:
       [+ URL] [+ File] --> Show chooser

- Load/Save of feeds in feed editor
  - Load dialog
    - Allows delete
    - Radio button to show "remote feeds"
    - Button in table to "load"
  - Save button
    - Saves locally, shows message "successfully saved, etc."
    - Adds to the "feeds list", object 
      - Object includes a GUID that maps to another persistent record
      - LocalFeed.guid, etc.
  - Most of the code should go in common
  - Front-end must be updated to know how to load (and restore when return to app) "local" feeds

- Scraping, etc.
  - Add "magic" methods to type registry (see Wii-mednafen, others)
  - When reading file, add code to hash file (after removing header)
  - Import the Retroarch files in a simple JSON format for identifying types based on hash
  - {
      "hash": [type, name]
    }
  - Pull description from: https://github.com/billyc999/RetroFe-Game-info/tree/master/RetroFE%20Story%20Files/Atari%207800
  - Pull images from retroarch? At least thumbs... backgrounds are not great...

- Proxy image sizing in editor
  - How to see defaults, set that override, etc.
  - Should this be a global setting?
- Ability to "re-analyze" files, attach description, artwork, etc...

- Documentation for Editor
- Home page, description and link for editor in one of bottom cells
- Documentation for imgbox, preferred due to compat w/ proxy resize, (also possible: imgpile, postimage)
